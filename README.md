This project will behave as the dedicated TMS tile-server for the Mambo Project (Hackers Against Natural Disasters).

It uses a lightweight tile-server (tilestrata) and supports both file tiles (cache), mbtiles, and proxy layers.

To configure the tile-server, simply change the content of the conf/conf.js file.

To run the server, simply run ```npm start```.

The app is listening on port 8082 by default.
